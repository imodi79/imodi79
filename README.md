### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have been actively involved in web development since 2001, specializing in the creation of web applications and websites. With expertise in both frontend and backend technologies, I proficiently utilize JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for frontend development, while employing PHP, primarily Symfony and Laravel, for backend solutions.

Currently, I am focusing on the development of web applications, particularly in the areas of accounting, administration, and business process automation, leveraging my extensive experience in the field.

In addition to my development work, I also share my knowledge and expertise as a lecturer on e-administration at the Public Administration and Management Faculty of Babes-Bolyai University, Sfantu Gheorghe department.
